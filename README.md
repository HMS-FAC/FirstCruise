# FirstCruise

## What?

A React and D3 component which displays points on a map. These points will expand to show information concerning whatever is assigned to the point. This is our development repo and we will soon have a publishing repo (for npm).

## Why?

We are practising React and integrating D3 into it for the first time. We plan to use D3Act to accomplish this. We also want to produce a handy tool for visualising information on a map.  

## How?

If you would like to download the repo, you will need to type these commands into your terminal:

1. ```npm install```
2. ```npm run dev:build```
3. ```npm run dev:start```

You will then have a ```bundle.js``` file, and the page will be available at localhost:8080/bundle.

## Props to pass to component
